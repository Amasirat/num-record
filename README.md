# num-record
An end of term project for Tehran University's Introduction to Computer Systems and Programming written in C++(First Term)

The goal of the project:
Develop a program that can do three things:

1.Take a natural number from user and check if it's prime or not and store that information, so that it can read from that file the next time the user enters that same number

2.The same process as the first, however this time check if it's a perfect number or not

3.Generate 10 random numbers and store them on record, basically adding them to the data pool of numbers with their prime and perfect states being known in the process
